# week-4-game

Simple RPG game built with HTML, CSS, JS, and jQuery.

Select a player and then your enemy. If you defeat your enemy, select another and defeat it until all your enemies have gone.
You will lose life in battle and there is no way to regenerate it... chose wisely the order of who you fight to win the game.
